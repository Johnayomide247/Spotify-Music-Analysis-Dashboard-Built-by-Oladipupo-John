# ðŸ“Š Measures Created in DAX
# Total Streams = SUM('Spotify Dataset'[Streams])

# Average Streams = AVERAGE('Spotify Dataset'[Streams])

# No of Tracks = COUNT('Spotify Dataset'[Track Name])

# Top Streamed Song = CALCULATE(MAX('Spotify Dataset'[Streams]))

# Monthly Streams = SUMX(SUMMARIZE('Spotify Dataset', 'Spotify Dataset'[Month], "MonthlySum", SUM('Spotify Dataset'[Streams])), [MonthlySum])

# Daily Streams = SUMMARIZE('Spotify Dataset', 'Spotify Dataset'[Day], "TotalStreams", SUM('Spotify Dataset'[Streams]))

# (Additional DAX measures can be listed here based on what's in your actual PBIX.)

### âœ… Recommendations
# 1. **Release on Fridays**: Most streams occur on Fridays â€” align track drops accordingly.  
# 2. **Focus on Danceable, High-Energy Songs**: These attributes correlate with streaming success.  
# 3. **Target High-Performing Months**: January and September show strong average stream performance.  
# 4. **Boost Promotions Around Top Tracks**: Leverage streaming stars for audience engagement.  
# 5. **Curate Audio Feature-Specific Playlists**: Use characteristics like speechiness or energy for smart playlisting.
